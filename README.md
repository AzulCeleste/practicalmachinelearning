# practicalmachinelearning: Assignment of the course

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants who performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 

The training data for this project are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-tes

Data was taken from the website: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har 

Requirements of the project:
1) describe how you built your model,
2) describe how you used cross validation, 
3) determine the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did, and 
4) use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
